## What Is Project Moros

Project Moros as said above is a game site project that aims to bypass web filters and deliver quality over quantity. This means that there will be monthly content updates[^1] bringing a few games, and patches to existing games more often.

---

### Main Principles

Some of the core concepts of the site are to have a dynamic URL, quality over quantity, and open source (mostly).

The idea of a dynamic URL is perfect because it will change the site URL monthly which means it is very hard to block the site. The URL will have a specific format and will follow that for a year and then the URL format will change. Example:

```js
URL Format 1: "https://interwebs.place/MMYYprojectmoros"
URL Format 2: "https://interwebs.place/MMYY-projmor"
URL Format 3: "https://interwebs.place/MMYYpm"

Example URL: "https://interwebs.place/0522projectmoros"
// In this case it would be May 2022's link
```

However, there is a main website with the sole purpose of posting these new links each month and a bit about the site.

**Quality over quantity** is very important for the simple reason that we don't want to be posting games of low quality or rushed releases where it's broken/buggy and it results in multiple patches to get it to a usable state. This will result in releases with new games to be posted every month[^1] and patches to fix things on a random basis.

The last principle is **open-sourcing** everything. There will be no asset on the site that is closed-sourced. The only exception to this rule is certain exploits/bypasses we want to keep to ourselves so they are not patched.

## Why Ads?

To put it simply, we would like to make some amount of money for the 100+ hours invested into making this website. It doesn't feel right not getting anything in return for all the work we've put into Project Moros. I'm sorry for the ads and we do plan on implementing a way to go ad-free for something like $5. (As of right now, there are no ads on the site so don't worry)
